# Data-Modeling-with-Apache-Cassandra

THESE FILES WERE WRITTEN FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF COMPLETING AN ASSIGNMENT FOR THE COURSE 'DATA MODELING WITH APACHE CASSANDRA' IN THE DATA ENGINEERING NANODEGREE PROGRAM AT UDACITY. ASSIGNMENTS PROVIDE SKELETAL CODE AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED/FILLED IN BY THE STUDENT. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE CODE WAS NOT OF MY OWN WRITING, BUT CREDITED TO THIS DEGREE PROGRAM AND ITS INSTRUCTORS. 


Data Modeling and ETL pipeline using Apache Cassandra
Given .csv files of logs of session logs on "Sparkify" music database, demonstrate knowledge of how to:

1) create an Apache Cassandra Keyspace
2) build tables around desired queries 
3) bulk insert data into tables
4) identify partition keys, clustering columns and using combinations to create primary keys
5) build queries produce desired results (answer the questions given)

This is a python script using the cassandra module wrapper.
